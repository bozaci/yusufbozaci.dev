            Iâ€™ve been dealing with software for 3 years and Iâ€™ve been working as a front-end

            Since I like the front-end field more, I am progressing in this field. Rather than
            developing projects only in the front-end area, I am also actively making project-based
            developments in the wordpress development section.

            I forgot to mention that I am actively developing freelance projects. I really enjoy
            doing freelance projects, and I must say that I learned a lot during this time.
